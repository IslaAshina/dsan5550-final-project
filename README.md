### Abstract: Predictive Analysis of Sea Level Rise along California's Coastline

By: Hongxin Wu

Accurate prediction of coastal water levels is crucial for mitigating risks and supporting decision-making in coastal communities. This project aims to develop and compare multiple models for forecasting water levels along California's coastline, focusing on both short-term (hourly, up to 24 hours) and long-term (2050, 2100, and 2200) predictions. The study employs a multi-model approach, utilizing time series analysis (ARIMA and SARIMA), machine learning (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines), and deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory networks) to capture the complex dynamics of coastal water levels.

The project leverages historical and current climate data from various sources, including satellite observations, tide gauges, and climate models. The data undergoes a refinement process involving cleaning, normalization, interpolation, and outlier detection to ensure the highest quality input for the predictive models. The models' performances are evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (Coefficient of Determination), along with qualitative evaluation techniques and rigorous validation procedures.

The project's findings contribute to the advancement of coastal water level forecasting techniques and demonstrate the potential of combining traditional time series analysis with machine learning and deep learning methods. The outcomes of this study can inform future research, guide the development of similar forecasting systems in other locations, and support decision-making processes related to coastal management and resilience planning. Moreover, the project exemplifies responsible and sustainable AI practices by transparently reporting its carbon footprint using CodeCarbon.

By providing accurate and reliable water level predictions, this project aims to enhance the resilience of coastal communities in California and serve as a valuable case study for researchers and practitioners addressing similar challenges in other coastal regions worldwide. The project's innovative approach, potential for knowledge transfer, and dedication to sustainable AI practices not only provide actionable insights into coastal water level fluctuations but also advance methodologies and best practices in the field while promoting sustainability in scientific research.
