### Abstract: Predictive Analysis of Sea Level Rise along California's Coastline

By: Hongxin Wu

This project aims to enhance coastal water level forecasting accuracy along California's coastline by developing and comparing multiple predictive models. Utilizing a rich dataset comprising satellite observations, historical sea level records from tide gauges, and climate model projections, we implement a variety of predictive techniques including Time Series Analysis (ARIMA and SARIMA), Machine Learning (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines), and Deep Learning (LSTM Networks). The objective is to provide precise hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours, crucial for immediate coastal management, and less precise long-term predictions up to the year 2200, which are vital for strategic planning against sea-level rise impacts. Model performance will be assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared metrics, with validations against observed data and authoritative projections. The project's broader contribution lies in advancing water level forecasting methodologies by integrating traditional time series analysis with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. Additionally, this study emphasizes sustainable AI practices by incorporating CodeCarbon to document and mitigate the environmental impact of computational research. Through this innovative approach, the project not only seeks to improve prediction accuracy but also to set a benchmark for sustainable scientific practices in environmental research.
