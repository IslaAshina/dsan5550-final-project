### Abstract: Predictive Analysis of Sea Level Rise along California's Coastline

By: Hongxin Wu

This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting sea level rise along California's coastline, leveraging historical and current climate data to assess potential impacts on coastal infrastructure and ecosystems. With the increasing urgency of climate change, accurate predictions are crucial for informed decision-making in urban planning, conservation efforts, and policy-making. The project sources data from satellite observations of sea surface height, historical sea level records from tide gauges, and climate models and projections. The data refinement process will involve cleaning, normalization, interpolation, and outlier detection to ensure data quality. We will employ a two-pronged modeling approach using Time Series Analysis with ARIMA for linear trend analysis and Deep Learning with LSTM networks to handle complex non-linear relationships. Model performance will be evaluated through metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared, with additional validation against observed changes and projections from authoritative sources like the IPCC. By providing actionable insights and enhancing resources for the climate research community, this project underscores the significance of sustainable methodologies in scientific research.
